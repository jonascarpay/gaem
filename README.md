# Untitled game engine framework

An attempt to make a composable game engine.

The goal is
  1. easy event handling/control flow
  2. games that are portable across backends (like gloss/brick/vty/your own).

A lot of the ideas/internals are copied from `pipes`, but not in a way that makes it fast (yet).

Don't use this.
